### Template 1: Cold Outreach (Most Effective)
**Subject:** NYC Property Risk Alert - [Their Property Address] has [X] violations

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you invest in/manage NYC real estate. We track violation data for 14,691+ NYC properties.

[Their Property Address] (from your portfolio) has:
- [X] active violations
- [Y] heat/plumbing complaints  
- Risk score: [Z]/100 ([risk level])

Our platform, ViolationSentinel, monitors this daily. Would a 14-day trial help your due diligence process?

**Connection Request:**
Hi [First Name], I help real estate investors avoid properties with violation histories. Would love to connect.

Thanks for connecting! I noticed you work with NYC real estate. Our system tracks violation data for 14,691+ properties. Could I send you a sample report for a property in your portfolio?

### Template 3: Follow-up (3 days later)
**Subject:** Following up - NYC property risk data

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my previous email about NYC property violation monitoring.

Quick question: When evaluating a property, how do you currently check for:
1. Active HPD violations?
2. 311 complaint history?
3. Risk patterns across similar properties?

Our system automates all three. Could I schedule a 10-minute demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

## 🎯 RESPONSE HANDLING

### When They Ask for Sample:
1. Send `nyc_compliance_demo_20260114_0336.csv`
2. Include 2-3 properties from their area
3. Offer to run a specific address

### When They Ask About Pricing:
"We have three tiers:
- Free: 10 lookups/month
- Pro ($297/month): 1,000 API calls, full analytics
- Enterprise ($999/month): 10,000+ calls, custom feeds

Most investors start with Pro. Would you like a 14-day trial?"

### When They Say "Too Expensive":
"I understand. What if I showed you how this data could help you avoid just ONE bad property? A single problematic property can cost $50k+ in violations and lost rent.

Could we do a 7-day trial at $147 (50% off first month)?"
